I'm a focused and determined data scientist who excels at machine learning, data wrangling, and data visualizations. My passion for data science began when I saw I could apply my analytical skills to solve real-world business problems. I have experience working with a wide variety of data sets, including using AWS and PySpark to work with big data (174 GB) for my capstone project at Lambda School. I enjoy exploring text data with natural language processing, and I want to continue to learn more about using NLP techniques combined with neural networks for some personal projects.
